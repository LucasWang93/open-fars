Title: GeoWorld: Geometric World Models

Abstract: Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

Although the success of LLMs stems from modeling within language space, which serves as a shortcut toward human level knowledge [ 48 ] , they still fail to fully represent the rich information of the real world, such as its physical and geometric properties [ 3 ] . In the real world, human and biological cognition often acquire knowledge primarily through visual information rather than relying solely on language, as vision offers a higher bandwidth of information than language [ 62 ] . For example, human infants learn mainly from visual perception during the first few months before developing a language system [ 38 ] , and some animals do not possess language at all [ 18 ] . Therefore, there are world models [ 46 , 59 , 63 , 4 , 3 ] that learn solely from visual input, such as videos, and perform planning with either a generative or a predictive approach. Generative world models [ 46 , 59 , 63 ] explicitly generate pixels or latent visual tokens that decode into pixels in order to predict only one step at a time [ 67 ] . As a result, they lack awareness of the full trajectory structure or the energy landscape over multiple steps. In contrast, predictive world models [ 2 , 29 , 4 , 3 ] such as JPEA [ 41 ] do not generate pixels. Instead, they learn an energy landscape in latent space that measures the compatibility between current and target states. This enables multi-step hierarchical planning, where high-level reasoning minimizes energy in latent space, while lower-level modules fill in the physical details. However, existing energy-based predictive world models face two significant challenges: (1) Geometric neglect. Although predictive world models perform multi-step hierarchical planning in latent space, their representations are typically learned in a Euclidean space without preserving the underlying geometric relations among states. As a result, the learned energy landscape fails to capture meaningful geodesic distances or hierarchical embeddings between latent states [ 51 ] , which weakens the model’s ability to perform geometry-consistent planning over long horizons. (2) Multi-step shortcoming. Multi-step videos are limited and expensive to acquire, so existing predictive world models are primarily trained on one-step video transitions [ 31 , 40 , 66 , 12 , 37 , 47 ] . Although learning an energy landscape over entire trajectories conceptually enables long-horizon planning, their performance degrades rapidly as the planning horizon increases, exposing a weakness in modeling long-term temporal dependencies. Our motivation is to address these problems from a geometric perspective. For the first challenge, a geometry-aware world model is required to preserve geometric properties when learning the energy landscape for hierarchical planning. For the second challenge, reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in adjusting a pretrained foundation model when its outputs are unsatisfactory in certain aspects [ 54 , 60 ] . Therefore, a geometry-aware RL method is required to obtain optimal trajectories on the latent manifold, improving the model’s multi-step planning capability. Hence, we introduce the Geometric World Model ( GeoWorld ), a method that enhances energy-based predictive world models by preserving geometric structure and hierarchical awareness in latent space, as shown in Figure LABEL:fig:teaser . To address the first challenge, we propose Hyperbolic JEPA ( H-JEPA ), which maps latent representations from Euclidean space ℝ n \mathbb{R}^{n} onto a hyperbolic manifold ℍ n \mathbb{H}^{n} , where geodesic distances naturally encode hierarchical relations among states. By learning dynamics along hyperbolic geodesics, H-JEPA preserves latent geometry during multi-step prediction, ensuring that the learned energy landscape aligns with the underlying structure of the physical world and supports geometry-consistent planning, as shown in 1 . To address the second challenge, we design a Geometric Reinforcement Learning ( GRL ) that reformulates multi-step planning as the optimization of an energy-based value function, where lower hyperbolic energy corresponds to higher cumulative reward. GRL directly optimizes the predictor of the world model without training an additional policy or reward model. By adjusting the predictor’s energy-based value representation through hyperbolic geodesics minimization and triangle inequality regularization, GRL enforces geodesic-consistent rollouts on the latent manifold, effectively improving long-horizon stability and planning performance.

We visualize the energy by sweeping two orthonormal tangent-space directions ( Δ ​ x , Δ ​ y ) (\Delta x,\Delta y) around a reference latent state. GeoWorlds yields a structured, curvature-aware energy landscape that better reflects geometric structure and hierarchical relations among latent states and improves energy-based planning. For more details see Appendix 4 . To verify our method’s capability on long-horizon planning, we evaluate multi-step goal-conditioned visual planning on standard benchmarks, including CrossTask [ 88 ] and COIN [ 71 ] . Our GeoWorld achieves consistent improvements over the previous state-of-the-art predictive world model V-JEPA 2, including improvements of around 3% SR in 3-step planning and 2% SR in 4-step planning across both datasets. The contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: • We introduce the Geometric World Model ( GeoWorld ) with a Hyperbolic JEPA ( H-JEPA ), which preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations by mapping latent representations onto a hyperbolic manifold and learning dynamics along hyperbolic geodesics, resulting in a geometry-consistent energy landscape for multi-step prediction and planning. • We propose Geometric Reinforcement Learning ( GRL ), an energy-based optimization framework that directly refines the predictor through hyperbolic energy minimization and triangle-inequality regularization, enabling geodesic-consistent rollouts and improving long-horizon planning stability. • We demonstrate strong performance on long-horizon goal-conditioned visual planning across CrossTask and COIN, achieving around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to V-JEPA 2. 2 Related Works Video World Models There are two primary approaches for video world modeling: generative world models [ 46 , 59 , 63 ] and predictive world models [ 41 , 2 , 29 , 4 , 3 ] . Generative world models typically build upon autoregressive [ 24 , 77 , 43 ] or semi-autoregressive [ 58 , 34 , 22 , 72 , 81 , 17 ] architectures that observe the visual context and explicitly generate the next frame or its latent representation. These models often incorporate an inverse dynamics module [ 67 ] trained to infer actions from consecutive observations, enabling one-step reactive control but preventing multi-step reasoning because the model lacks access to the global trajectory structure and cannot capture long-range dynamics. Moreover, generative approaches must decode visual tokens or pixels during planning, which introduces unnecessary noise and computational overhead and limits their ability to model abstract energy landscapes for hierarchical planning [ 59 ] . In contrast, predictive world models do not generate pixels. Instead, they learn an energy landscape in latent space that quantifies the compatibility between current and target states [ 41 ] . This design allows for multi-step trajectory optimization using sampling-based planners such as the cross-entropy method (CEM) [ 23 ] , enabling long-horizon planning without explicit pixel decoding. Goal-Conditioned Visual Planning Goal conditioned visual planning aims to produce a sequence of actions that achieves a given goal based on visual observations. Prior works have evolved into three independent setups depending on the modalities of the observation and the goal, which may be images, videos, or language. (1) In visual planning for assistance (VPA) [ 56 ] , observations are videos and goals are described in natural language. This typically requires models built on LLMs with multimodal processing capability [ 36 , 84 , 16 ] . (2) In procedural planning (PP) [ 15 ] , both observations and goals are specified as images without any language involved, which limits the model’s ability to capture temporal information in the physical world [ 42 , 36 , 52 , 7 , 86 , 75 , 50 , 61 , 87 , 69 , 74 ] . (3) In visual planning with videos, both observations and goals are given as videos, which aligns more naturally with temporal dynamics in the real world and is commonly addressed using video LLMs [ 76 , 79 , 20 , 53 ] , generative world models [ 59 ] , and predictive world models [ 3 ] . Figure 2 : Overview of GeoWorld. Our geometric world model integrates Hyperbolic JEPA for geometry-preserving latent dynamics and Geometric Reinforcement Learning for geodesic-consistent multi-step refinement. Together with energy-based planning using CEM, GeoWorld enables stable and geometry-aware long-horizon visual planning. 3 Method 3.1 Overview We introduce GeoWorld , a geometric world model designed to enhance long-horizon visual planning by preserving geometric structure and hierarchical awareness in latent space. To address the limitation of Euclidean latent representations, GeoWorld incorporates Hyperbolic JEPA (H-JEPA), which maps encoder outputs from Euclidean space onto a hyperbolic manifold where geodesic distances naturally encode hierarchical relations among states. By learning latent dynamics along hyperbolic geodesics, H-JEPA enforces geometry-consistent transitions that better reflect the structure of real-world trajectories. To further improve stability in multi-step prediction, we develop Geometric Reinforcement Learning (GRL), an energy-based optimization framework that treats planning as minimizing a hyperbolic value function without training an additional policy or reward model. GRL refines the predictor through hyperbolic energy minimization and triangle-inequality regularization, encouraging geodesic-consistent rollouts and improving long-horizon temporal coherence. Leveraging energy-based planning with the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) [ 23 ] further enables efficient trajectory optimization by searching for action sequences that follow geodesic paths in hyperbolic latent space. Together, H-JEPA and GRL form the core of GeoWorld, enabling geometry-aware multi-step planning in predictive world models, as shown in Figure 2 . For preliminaries on JEPA [ 41 ] , hyperbolic geometry, and the value function in RL, see Appendix 1 . 3.2 Hyperbolic JEPA From a representation perspective, we aim to learn a mapping from states onto a hyperbolic space ℍ n \mathbb{H}^{n} such that the optimal plan corresponds to a geodesic in hyperbolic space. Hence, we propose Hyperbolic JEPA ( H-JEPA ), which models latent dynamics on the hyperbolic manifold to preserve hierarchical relations and underlying geometric coherence during multi-step planning. We define the observation at time t t as x t x_{t} . E θ ​ ( ⋅ ) E_{\theta}(\cdot) denotes the pretrained encoder [ 3 ] , which encodes the observation x t x_{t} into the latent state s t x s_{t}^{x} : s t x = E θ ​ ( x t ) ∈ ℝ n . s_{t}^{x}=E_{\theta}(x_{t})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}. (1) To effectively map the encoder output from Euclidean space ℝ n \mathbb{R}^{n} to hyperbolic space ℍ n \mathbb{H}^{n} , we interpret the Euclidean embedding s t x s_{t}^{x} as a tangent vector in the tangent space 𝐓 0 ​ ℍ n \mathbf{T}_{0}\mathbb{H}^{n} at the origin. We then apply the exponential map at the origin of the Poincaré ball model 𝔹 c n \mathbb{B}_{c}^{n} with curv
