We show that, similar to the optimal interactive learner, SGD undergoes a distinct ``burn-in'' phase before entering the ``learning'' phase in this setting. Moreover, with an appropriately chosen learning rate schedule, a single SGD procedure simultaneously achieves near-optimal (or best-known) sample complexity and regret guarantees across both phases, for a broad class of link functions. Our results demonstrate that SGD remains highly competitive for learning single-index models under adaptive data.

Recent theoretical advances have provided rigorous analyses of SGD in high-dimensional, non-convex settings for a range of statistical and machine learning tasks, such as tensor decomposition [ GHJ+15 ] , PCA [ WML17 ] , phase retrieval [ CCF+19 , TV23 ] , to name a few. A particularly intriguing setting is that of single-index models [ DH18 , BGJ21 ] (and generalizations to multi-index models [ AAM22 , AAM23 , DLS22 , ASK+23 , BBP25 ] ) with Gaussian data. In this framework, each observation ( x t , y t ) (x_{t},y_{t}) consists of a Gaussian feature x t ∼ 𝒩 ​ ( 0 , I d ) x_{t}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d}) and a noisy outcome y t = f ​ ( ⟨ θ ⋆ , x t ⟩ ) + ε t , \displaystyle y_{t}=f(\langle{\theta^{\star},x_{t}}\rangle)+\varepsilon_{t}, where f : ℝ → ℝ f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} is a known link function, θ ⋆ ∈ 𝕊 d − 1 \theta^{\star}\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1} is an unknown parameter vector on the unit sphere in ℝ d \mathbb{R}^{d} , and ε t \varepsilon_{t} denotes the unobserved noise. With a learning rate η t 0 \eta_{t} 0 and a random initialization θ 1 ∼ Unif ​ ( 𝕊 d − 1 ) \theta_{1}\sim\mathrm{Unif}(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) , the SGD update for learning single-index models is given by θ t + 1 / 2 = θ t − η t ​ ( f ​ ( ⟨ θ t , x t ⟩ ) − y t ) ​ f ′ ​ ( ⟨ θ t , x t ⟩ ) ⋅ ( I − θ t ​ θ t ⊤ ) ​ x t , θ t + 1 = θ t + 1 / 2 ‖ θ t + 1 / 2 ‖ . \displaystyle\begin{split}\theta_{t+1/2}=\theta_{t}-\eta_{t}(f(\langle{\theta_{t},x_{t}}\rangle)-y_{t})f^{\prime}(\langle{\theta_{t},x_{t}}\rangle)\cdot(I-\theta_{t}\theta_{t}^{\top})x_{t},\quad\theta_{t+1}=\frac{\theta_{t+1/2}}{\|\theta_{t+1/2}\|}.\end{split} (1) Here, the first update is a descent step of the population loss θ ↦ 1 2 ​ 𝔼 ​ ( f ​ ( ⟨ θ , x ⟩ ) − y ) 2 \theta\mapsto\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left(f(\langle{\theta,x}\rangle)-y\right)^{2} at θ = θ t \theta=\theta_{t} , whose spherical gradient 1 1 1 Recall that the spherical gradient of a function f : 𝕊 d − 1 → ℝ f:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to\mathbb{R} is defined as ∇ f = D ​ f − ∂ f ∂ r ​ ∂ ∂ r \nabla f=Df-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} , where D ​ f Df is the Euclidean gradient, and ∂ ∂ r \frac{\partial}{\partial r} is the derivative in the radial direction. is estimated based on the current sample ( x t , y t ) (x_{t},y_{t}) . It is well known (cf. e.g. [ BGJ21 ] ) that the evolution of SGD in this context exhibits two distinct phases: an initial “search” phase, during which the correlation ⟨ θ t , θ ⋆ ⟩ \langle{\theta_{t},\theta^{\star}}\rangle gradually improves from O ​ ( d − 1 / 2 ) O(d^{-1/2}) to Ω ​ ( 1 ) \Omega(1) , followed by a “descent” phase in which the iterates θ t \theta_{t} converge rapidly to the global optimum θ ⋆ \theta^{\star} , driving ⟨ θ t , θ ⋆ ⟩ \langle{\theta_{t},\theta^{\star}}\rangle arbitrarily close to 1 1 . Beyond statistical learning, single-index models have found applications in interactive decision-making problems, including bandits and reinforcement learning, where the reward is a nonlinear function of the action. An example is manipulation with object interaction, which represents one of the largest open problems in robotics [ BK19 ] and requires designing good sequential decision rules that can deal with sparse and non-linear reward functions and continuous action spaces [ ZGR+19 ] . This setting is known as the generalized linear bandit or ridge bandit in the bandit literature, where the mean reward satisfies 𝔼 ​ [ r t | a t ] = f ​ ( ⟨ θ ⋆ , a t ⟩ ) \mathbb{E}[r_{t}|a_{t}]=f(\langle{\theta^{\star},a_{t}}\rangle) with a known link function f f . Classical results [ FCG+10 , RV14 ] show that when 0 c 1 ≤ f ′ ​ ( x ) ≤ c 2 0 c_{1}\leq f^{\prime}(x)\leq c_{2} everywhere, both the optimal regret and the optimal learner are essentially the same as in the linear bandit case (where f ​ ( x ) = x f(x)=x ). Recent studies [ LH21 , HHK+21 , RHJ+24 ] have considered challenging settings where f ′ ​ ( x ) f^{\prime}(x) could be small around x = 0 x=0 . This line of work yields two main insights: 1. While the final “learning” phase has the same regret as linear bandits, there could be a long “burn-in” period until the learner can identify some action a t a_{t} with ⟨ θ ⋆ , a t ⟩ = Ω ​ ( 1 ) \langle{\theta^{\star},a_{t}}\rangle=\Omega(1) ; 2. New exploration algorithms are necessary during this burn-in period, as classical methods such as UCB are provably suboptimal for minimizing the initial exploration cost. In response to the second point, this line of research has proposed various exploration strategies for the burn-in phase that are often tailored to the specific link function f f and rely on noisy gradient estimates via zeroth-order optimization. In contrast, SGD offers a natural and straightforward alternative, as its intrinsic “search” and “descent” phases align well with the “burn-in” and “learning” phases encountered in interactive decision-making. This paper is devoted to a systematic study of SGD for learning single-index models, including the aforementioned challenging setting where f ′ ​ ( x ) f^{\prime}(x) could be small around x ≈ 0 x\approx 0 , within interactive decision-making settings. In these scenarios, the actions a t a_{t} are no longer Gaussian, prompting us to adopt the following exploration strategy: a t = 1 − σ t 2 ​ θ t + σ t ​ Z t , Z t ∼ Unif ​ ( { a ∈ 𝕊 d − 1 : ⟨ a , θ t ⟩ = 0 } ) , \displaystyle a_{t}=\sqrt{1-\sigma_{t}^{2}}\theta_{t}+\sigma_{t}Z_{t},\qquad Z_{t}\sim\mathrm{Unif}\left(\left\{a\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1}:\langle{a,\theta_{t}}\rangle=0\right\}\right), (2) where an additional hyperparameter σ t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] \sigma_{t}\in[0,1] governs the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. After playing the action a t a_{t} and observing the reward r t r_{t} , we update the parameter θ t \theta_{t} via the same SGD as ( 1 ): θ t + 1 / 2 = θ t − η t ​ ( f ​ ( ⟨ θ t , a t ⟩ ) − r t ) ​ f ′ ​ ( ⟨ θ t , a t ⟩ ) ⋅ ( I − θ t ​ θ t ⊤ ) ​ a t , θ t + 1 = θ t + 1 / 2 ‖ θ t + 1 / 2 ‖ . \displaystyle\begin{split}\theta_{t+1/2}=\theta_{t}-\eta_{t}(f(\langle{\theta_{t},a_{t}}\rangle)-r_{t})f^{\prime}(\langle{\theta_{t},a_{t}}\rangle)\cdot(I-\theta_{t}\theta_{t}^{\top})a_{t},\quad\theta_{t+1}=\frac{\theta_{t+1/2}}{\|\theta_{t+1/2}\|}.\end{split} (3) By simple algebra, the stochastic gradient in ( 3 ) is also an unbiased estimator of the population (spherical) gradient of θ ↦ 1 2 ​ 𝔼 ​ ( f ​ ( ⟨ θ , a ⟩ ) − r ) 2 \theta\mapsto\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}\left(f(\langle{\theta,a}\rangle)-r\right)^{2} at θ = θ t \theta=\theta_{t} , with the distribution of a a given by ( 2 ) and the reward r = f ​ ( ⟨ θ ⋆ , a ⟩ ) + ε r=f(\langle{\theta^{\star},a}\rangle)+\varepsilon . Our main result will establish that, for a broad class of link functions, this SGD procedure, with appropriately chosen hyperparameters ( η t , σ t ) (\eta_{t},\sigma_{t}) , achieves near-optimal performance in both the burn-in and learning phases. Notation. For x ∈ ℝ d x\in\mathbb{R}^{d} , let ‖ x ‖ \|x\| be its ℓ 2 \ell_{2} norm. For x , y ∈ ℝ d x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{d} , let ⟨ x , y ⟩ \langle{x,y}\rangle be their inner product. Let 𝕊 d − 1 \mathbb{S}^{d-1} be the unit sphere in ℝ d \mathbb{R}^{d} . Throughout this paper we will use θ ⋆ ∈ 𝕊 d − 1 \theta^{\star}\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1} to denote the true parameter, θ t \theta_{t} to denote the current estimate, and m t = ⟨ θ ⋆ , θ t ⟩ ∈ [ − 1 , 1 ] m_{t}=\langle{\theta^{\star},\theta_{t}}\rangle\in[-1,1] to denote the correlation . The standard asymptotic notations o , O , Ω o,O,\Omega , etc. are used throughout the paper, and we also use O ~ , Ω ~ \widetilde{O},\widetilde{\Omega} , etc. to denote the respective meanings with hidden poly-logarithmic factors. 1.1 Main results First we give a formal formulation of the single-index model in the interactive setting. Let θ ⋆ ∈ 𝕊 d − 1 \theta^{\star}\in\mathbb{S}^{d-1} be an unknown parameter vector, and 𝒜 = 𝕊 d − 1 \mathcal{A}=\mathbb{S}^{d-1} be the action space. Upon choosing an action a t ∈ 𝒜 a_{t}\in\mathcal{A} , the learner receives a reward r t = f ​ ( ⟨ θ ⋆ , a t ⟩ ) + ε t r_{t}=f(\langle{\theta^{\star},a_{t}}\rangle)+\varepsilon_{t} for a known link function f : [ − 1 , 1 ] → ℝ f:[-1,1]\to\mathbb{R} and an unobserved noise ε t \varepsilon_{t} which is assumed to be zero-mean and 1-subGaussian. Remark 1.1 . The scaling considered here differs crucially from the prior study on learning single-index models under non-interactive environments (such as [ DH18 , BGJ21 ] with Gaussian or i.i.d. features). In the non-interactive setting, it is usually assumed that x t ∼ 𝒩 ​ ( 0 , I d ) x_{t}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d}) , so that ‖ x t ‖ ≍ d \|x_{t}\|\asymp\sqrt{d} . In the interactive setting, we stick to the convention that actions belong to the unit ℓ 2 \ell_{2} ball, in line with settings considered in the bandit literature [ FCG+10 , RV14 , RHJ+24 ] . As a consequence, sample complexity comparisons between the interactive and non-interactive settings must be made with care. We discuss this in more detail in Section 5 and compare with results established for online SGD with Gaussian features [ BGJ21 ] after normalizing for the difference in scaling. Throughout the paper we make the following mild assumptions on the link function f f . Assumption 1.2 . The following conditions hold for the link function f f : 1. (monotonicity) f : [ − 1 , 1 ] → [ − 1 , 1 ] f:[-1,1]\to[-1,1] is non-decreasing, with ‖ f ‖ ∞ ≤ 1 \|f\|_{\infty}\leq 1 ; 2. (locally linear near x = 1 x=1 ) 0 γ 1 ≤ f ′ ​ ( x ) ≤ γ 2 0 \gamma_{1}\leq f^{\prime}(x)\leq\gamma_{2} for all x ∈ [ 1 − γ 0 , 1 ] x\in[1-\gamma_{0},1] , with absolute constants γ 0 , γ 1 , γ 2 0 \gamma_{0},\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2} 0 . Without loss of generality we assume that γ 0 ≤ 0.1 \gamma_{0}\leq 0.1 . In Section 1.1 , the monotonicity condition is taken from [ RHJ+24 ] to ensure that reward maximization is aligned with parameter estimation, where improving the alignment ⟨ θ ⋆ , a t ⟩ \langle{\theta^{\star},a_{t}}\rangle directly increases the learner’s reward. In addition, when it comes to SGD, we will show in Section 5 that the population loss associated with the SGD dynamics in ( 3 ) is decreasing in the correlation m t = ⟨ θ ⋆ , θ t ⟩ m_{t}=\langle{\theta^{\star},\theta_{t}}\rangle only if f f is increasing. Without monotonicity, there also exists a counterexample where the SGD can never make meaningful progress (cf. Section 5 ). Similar to [ RHJ+24 ] , this condition can be generalized to f f being even and non-decreasing on [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] , which covers, for example, f ​ ( x ) = | x | p f(x)=|x|^{p} for all p 0 p 0 . The second condition in section 1.1 is very mild, satisfied by many natural functions, and ensures that the problem locally resembles a linear bandit near the global optimum a t ≈ θ ⋆ a_{t}\approx\theta^{\star} . Finally, we emphasize that this local linearity does not exclude the nontrivial scenario where f ′ ​ ( x ) f^{\prime}(x) is very small when x ≈ 0 x\approx 0 . Our first result is the SGD dynamics in the learning phase, under Section 1.1 . Theorem 1.3 (Learning Phase) . Let ε , δ 0 \varepsilon,\delta 0 . Under section 1.1 , let ( a t , θ t ) t ≥ 1 (a_{t},\theta_{t})_{t\geq 1} be given by the SGD evolution in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ), with an initialization θ 1 \theta_{1} such that ⟨ θ 1 , θ ⋆ ⟩ ≥ 1 − γ 0 / 4 \langle{\theta_{1},\theta^{\star}}\rangle\geq 1-\gamma_{0}/4 . 1. (Pure exploration) By choosing η t = Θ ~ ​ ( d t ∧ 1 d ) \eta_{t}=\widetilde{\Theta}(\frac{d}{t}\wedge\frac{1}{d}) and σ t 2 = Θ ​ ( 1 ) \sigma_{t}^{2}=\Theta(1) , it holds that m T ≥ 1 − ε m_{T}\geq 1-\varepsilon with probability at least 1 − δ ​ T 1-\delta T , with T = O ~ ​ ( d 2 ε ) T=\widetilde{O}(\frac{d^{2}}{\varepsilon}) . 2. (Regret minimization) By choosing η t = Θ ~ ​ ( 1 t ∧ 1 d ) \eta_{t}=\widetilde{\Theta}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}\wedge\frac{1}{d}) and σ t 2 = Θ ~ ​ ( d t ∧ 1 ) \sigma_{t}^{2}=\widetilde{\Theta}(\frac{d}{\sqrt{t}}\wedge 1) , with probability at least 1 − δ ​ T 1-\delta T it holds that ∑ t = 1 T ( f ​ ( 1 ) − f ​ ( m t ) ) = O ~ ​ ( d ​ T ) \sum_{t=1}^{T}(f(1)-f(m_{t}
