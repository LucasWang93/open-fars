Title: Friends and Foes in Learning from Noisy Labels

Abstract: Learning from examples with noisy labels has attracted increasing attention recently. But, this paper will show that the commonly used CIFAR-based datasets and the accuracy evaluation metric used in the literature are both inappropriate in this context. An alternative valid evaluation metric and new datasets are proposed in this paper to promote proper research and evaluation in this area. Then, friends and foes are identified from existing methods as technical components that are either beneficial or detrimental to deep learning from noisy labeled examples, respectively, and this paper improves and combines technical components from the friends category, including self-supervised learning, new warmup strategy, instance filtering and label correction. The resulting F&amp;F method significantly outperforms existing methods on the proposed nCIFAR datasets and the real-world Clothing1M dataset.
