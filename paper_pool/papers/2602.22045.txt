Title: DLT-Corpus: A Large-Scale Text Collection for the Distributed Ledger Technology Domain

Abstract: We introduce DLT-Corpus, the largest domain-specific text collection for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) research to date: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning scientific literature (37,440 publications), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents (49,023 filings), and social media (22 million posts). Existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources for DLT focus narrowly on cryptocurrencies price prediction and smart contracts, leaving domain-specific language under explored despite the sector's ~$3 trillion market capitalization and rapid technological evolution.
  We demonstrate DLT-Corpus' utility by analyzing technology emergence patterns and market-innovation correlations. Findings reveal that technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional technology transfer patterns. While social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish even during crypto winters, scientific and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, tracking overall market expansion in a virtuous cycle where research precedes and enables economic growth that funds further innovation.
  We publicly release the full DLT-Corpus; LedgerBERT, a domain-adapted model achieving 23% improvement over BERT-base on a DLT-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) task; and all associated tools and code.

Introduction The Distributed Ledger Technology field lacks a comprehensive text corpus. While, at the time of this writing, the ecosystem has grown to ∼ \sim $3 trillion in market capitalization (Budish, 2025 ) and introduced new concepts such as stablecoins, Decentralized Exchanges, and Automated Market Makers (Hernandez Cruz et al. , 2025b ) , Natural Language Processing research within the Distributed Ledger Technology domain remains constrained by narrow, task-specific datasets that overlook substantial textual resources in scientific publications, patents, and technical documentation. Current Distributed Ledger Technology datasets focus primarily on cryptocurrency price prediction (McNally et al. , 2018 ; Seroyizhko et al. , 2022 ; Gurgul et al. , 2025 ) , trading (McNally et al. , 2018 ; Li et al. , 2024 ; Luo et al. , 2026 ; Ding et al. , 2025 ) , and smart contracts (Chen et al. , 2023 ; Yang et al. , 2023 ; Sun et al. , 2025 ; Kim et al. , 2024 ) . These resources support specific Natural Language Processing downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (Hernandez Cruz et al. , 2025b ) , Question Answering (Sarkar et al. , 2025 ) , sentiment analysis (Azmina et al. , 2022 ; Rasivisuth et al. , 2024 ) , but fail to capture the substantial textual resources available in scientific literature, patent filings, and technical documentation. This gap limits the development of practical Natural Language Processing applications: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that reduce Large Language Model hallucinations (Sarkar et al. , 2025 ) , patent landscape monitoring, protocol documentation analysis, and technology trend detection, to cite a few examples. Similarly, (Belcak et al. , 2025 ; Xiao et al. , 2025 ; Pecher et al. , 2025 ; Allal et al. , 2025 ; Juan et al. , 2024 ; Grangier et al. , 2024 ; Li et al. , 2023 ) demonstrate that small language models trained on domain-specific corpora outperform general-purpose Large Language Models on specialized tasks while remaining computationally efficient (Belcak et al. , 2025 ; Xiao et al. , 2025 ; Li et al. , 2023 ; Juan et al. , 2024 ) , highlighting the need for comprehensive Distributed Ledger Technology text resources. We introduce DLT-Corpus 1 1 1 https://huggingface.co/collections/ExponentialScience/dlt-corpus , the largest domain-specific text collection for Distributed Ledger Technology research: 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning open-access scientific literature 2 2 2 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Scientific-Literature , United States Patent and Trademark Office patent filings 3 3 3 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Patents , and Twitter/X posts 4 4 4 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Tweets collected before 2023 platform restrictions (Davidson et al. , 2023 ) . This corpus integrates technical specifications, economic mechanisms, community discourse, and governance frameworks, providing a foundation for Natural Language Processing systems tailored to the Distributed Ledger Technology domain. We demonstrate the corpus utility through two analyses. First, we track how technologies diffuse from scientific literature to patents to social media, finding that concepts such as stablecoins, Automated Market Makers, and Decentralized Exchanges consistently originate in research before reaching commercial and consumer communities. Second, we examine correlations between market dynamics and innovation activity, finding that scientific publications lead market expansion by two years ( ρ = 0.95 \rho=0.95 , p 0.001 p 0.001 ), while social media sentiment remains bullish (i.e., extremely optimistic) even during crypto winters. In summary, our contributions are: • DLT-Corpus 5 5 5 https://huggingface.co/collections/ExponentialScience/dlt-corpus : 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents (37,440 scientific publications, 49,023 patents, 22M social media posts) with rich metadata enabling cross-disciplinary research. • Innovation diffusion analysis : Evidence that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) follow traditional technology transfer patterns, with research preceding market expansion and creating a virtuous funding cycle. • Sentiment analysis dataset 6 6 6 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Sentiment-News : 23,301 cryptocurrency news headlines and brief descriptions with crowdsourced annotations from active community members, addressing the need for domain-specific labeled data. • LedgerBERT 7 7 7 https://huggingface.co/ExponentialScience/LedgerBERT : A domain-adapted language model achieving 23% improvement over BERT-base on Distributed Ledger Technology-specific Named Entity Recognition task, developed through continued pre-training of SciBERT (Beltagy et al. , 2019 ) . DLT-Corpus, sentiment analysis dataset, models, and code 8 8 8 https://github.com/dlt-science/DLT-Corpus are publicly available to support reproducibility and future research. 2. Background Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) refers to decentralized systems for recording and synchronizing data across multiple Peer-to-Peer nodes using cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms. While blockchain represents the most recognized Distributed Ledger Technology architecture, the term Distributed Ledger Technology encompasses diverse architectures, including Parachains (Wood, 2016 ) , Sidechain (Back et al. , 2014 ) , Holochain ( Harris-Braun et al. , ) , and Directed Acyclic Graphs (Raikwar et al. , 2024 ) (e.g., Hashgraph (Baird and Luykx, 2020 ) ), to cite a few examples. Therefore, while the term blockchain is generically used for any distributed ledger system, we distinguish in this study between blockchain (the chain-based architecture introduced by Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008 ) ) and Distributed Ledger Technology (the broader category including blockchain and other architectures) (Hernandez Cruz et al. , 2025b ) . 3. Related Work Existing Distributed Ledger Technology text resources are fragmented and narrow The Distributed Ledger Technology domain combines technical specifications (Baird and Luykx, 2020 ; Buterin, 2014 ; Nakamoto, 2008 ) , economic mechanisms (Lo and Medda, 2020 ; Moncada et al. , 2024 ; Biais et al. , 2025 ) , and social dynamics (Hernandez Cruz et al. , 2025b ; Cong et al. , 2025 ) , with rapid terminological evolution introducing concepts like Automated Market Makers, Decentralized Exchanges, stablecoins, Non-Fungible Tokens, and Maximal Extractable Value. Yet existing datasets focus narrowly on cryptocurrency markets: price prediction (McNally et al. , 2018 ; Seroyizhko et al. , 2022 ; Gurgul et al. , 2025 ; Kraaijeveld and De Smedt, 2020 ) , trading (Li et al. , 2024 ; Pawlicka Maule and Johnson, 2021 ) , fraud detection (Fu et al. , 2025 ; Li, 2025 ) , and sentiment analysis (Azmina et al. , 2022 ; Rasivisuth et al. , 2024 ; Guégan and Renault, 2021 ) . These datasets primarily extract social media content from Twitter/X, Telegram, and Reddit (Kraaijeveld and De Smedt, 2020 ; Kang et al. , 2024 ; Seroyizhko et al. , 2022 ) , but despite some studies collecting millions of tweets, this data is rarely publicly available. Other work relies on transactional data (Gai et al. , 2023 ; Sun et al. , 2025 ) and smart contracts (Chen et al. , 2023 ; Yang et al. , 2023 ; Kim et al. , 2024 ) , overlooking textual resources in scientific publications, patents, and technical documentation. General-purpose corpora such as RefinedWeb (Penedo et al. , 2023 ) , CommonCrawl, and C4 (Raffel et al. , 2019 ) contain some cryptocurrency content but lack domain specificity. Distributed Ledger Technology-Corpus addresses this gap by integrating scientific literature, United States Patent and Trademark Office patents, and Twitter/X data collected before 2023 API restrictions (Davidson et al. , 2023 ) , enabling both cross-domain analysis and domain-specific Natural Language Processing applications. Innovation diffusion in Distributed Ledger Technology lacks integrated analysis. Prior work on Distributed Ledger Technology domain analysis remains fragmented: Named Entity Recognition applied to scientific literature (Hernandez Cruz et al. , 2025b ) or patents (Yang et al. , 2024 ) , news-based studies (Perdana et al. , 2021 ) , taxonomies (Tasca and Tessone, 2017 ; Ballandies et al. , 2022 ) , and systematic reviews (Xu et al. , 2019 ; Gorkhali et al. , 2020 ) . Our work provides the first integrated analysis spanning scientific publications, patents, and community discourse ( §6 ), revealing how innovation emerges and diffuses across research, commercial, and user communities. 4. Datasets We introduce two datasets: • DLT-Corpus 9 9 9 https://huggingface.co/collections/ExponentialScience/dlt-corpus : 2.98 billion tokens from 22.12 million documents spanning scientific literature (37,440 publications), patents (49,023 filings), and social media (22M posts). This unstructured text corpus captures technical specifications, economic mechanisms, and community discourse across the Distributed Ledger Technology domain. • Sentiment analysis dataset 10 10 10 https://huggingface.co/datasets/ExponentialScience/DLT-Sentiment-News : 23,301 cryptocurrency news headlines (and a brief description of them) with crowdsourced annotations from active community members, enabling sentiment analysis research. We describe the construction of each dataset below. See Appendix A for complete documentation and data dictionaries ( Table 6 , Table 7 , Table 8 , Table 9 ). 4.1.

Overview of Distributed Ledger Technology-Corpus composition We construct the Distributed Ledger Technology-Corpus by aggregating text from three complementary sources that capture different aspects of the Distributed Ledger Technology ecosystem: academic and industry publications provide formal technical knowledge, patent filings reveal innovation trajectories, and social media reflect community discourse and market dynamics. This multi-source approach allows comprehensive coverage of technical terminology and evolving community language. Legal compliance We exclusively use open-access scientific literature and, whenever available, include in the metadata for each publication its license ( Table 6 ) information to ensure redistribution rights for research and commercial applications. Patent data derives from public United States Patent and Trademark Office records. Social media content was collected before Twitter/X’s 2023 Terms and Conditions changes that restricted API access on 18 May 2023 11 11 11 https://x.com/en/tos/previous/version_18 , preserving a valuable snapshot of community discourse. Then, the Distributed Ledger Technology-Corpus could facilitate academic research and industry use by mitigating legal barrie
