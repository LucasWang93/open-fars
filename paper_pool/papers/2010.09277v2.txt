Title: Modality-Pairing Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation

Abstract: Automatic brain tumor segmentation from multi-modality Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) using deep learning methods plays an important role in assisting the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor. However, previous methods mostly ignore the latent relationship among different modalities. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end Modality-Pairing learning method for brain tumor segmentation. Paralleled branches are designed to exploit different modality features and a series of layer connections are utilized to capture complex relationships and abundant information among modalities. We also use a consistency loss to minimize the prediction variance between two branches. Besides, learning rate warmup strategy is adopted to solve the problem of the training instability and early over-fitting. Lastly, we use average ensemble of multiple models and some post-processing techniques to get final results. Our method is tested on the BraTS 2020 online testing dataset, obtaining promising segmentation performance, with average dice scores of 0.891, 0.842, 0.816 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. We won the second place of the BraTS 2020 Challenge for the tumor segmentation task.
