Title: Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode.

I Introduction The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture has emerged as a key enabler of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile wireless networks [ 7 ] . O-RAN disaggregates the traditional base station into open radio units (O-RUs), open distributed units (O-DUs), and open central units (O-CUs). O-DUs host distributed applications (dApps) that execute real-time (sub- 10 10 ms) control logic [ 5 ] . O-RAN also introduces two RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). The near-real-time (near-RT) RIC hosts xApps that perform near-RT ( 10 10 ms to 1 1 s) control tasks. The non-RT RIC hosts rApps that perform non-RT (beyond 1 1 s) tasks [ 7 ] . Together, rApps, xApps, and dApps enable intelligent control of RAN across different timescales. For instance, in [ 6 ] , an xApp adjusts the weights of users in a proportional fair scheduler to guarantee the minimum data rate for each user. In [ 12 ] , an O-RU on/off controller rApp and an O-CU/O-DU function placement xApp are proposed to minimize the energy consumption in O-RAN. By leveraging the capabilities of the O-RAN architecture, researchers are now advancing the vision of autonomous RANs that use artificial intelligence (AI) to adapt and optimize without human intervention. A key enabler of this vision is agentic AI, where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to monitor, analyze, and control the RAN. Agentic AI provides human-like reasoning and adaptability while operating at machine speed and scale. Traditional RAN management requires operators to navigate complex dashboards and maintain expertise across diverse systems. In contrast, AI-enabled RANs allow operators to express high-level intents or long-term goals in natural language. The AI agents translate these directives into sub-tasks, configure the RAN, and monitor key performance indicators to achieve the desired outcome. Large language models (LLMs), with their exceptional natural language understanding, reasoning, and generalization capabilities, are promising enablers of agentic AI. Recent works have proposed various AI agents for O-RAN optimization. In [ 4 ] , LLM agents interpret the operator intents and match the intents to the most suitable scheduler. In [ 1 ] , an agent decomposes the operator intents into sub-tasks and invokes specialized agents to accomplish the objective. In [ 3 ] , a manager agent in the non-RT RIC decomposes the operator intents into sub-intents for power control and resource allocation agents in the near-RT RIC. The aforementioned works [ 4 , 1 , 3 ] only consider the scenario where the operator intents can be decomposed into non-overlapping objectives handled by independent agents. The case of complex intents that require inter-agent collaboration remains largely unexplored. Moreover, most works deploy a separate LLM for each agent, which may limit the scalability. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN, where each user is collaboratively served by multiple O-RUs. LLM-based agents translate the operator intents, which are expressed in natural language, into specific objectives and jointly determine the control parameters that achieve the desired outcome. The contributions of this paper are as follows: • We deploy multiple agents that operate at different timescales and interact through standardized interfaces. A supervisor agent in the non-RT RIC translates the operator intent into an objective function and minimum rate requirements. The objective function can be a utility function related to the data rates or energy saving. Based on this information, the user weighting agent in the near-RT RIC retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. In the energy-saving mode, the O-RU management agent invokes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to determine the set of active O-RUs. The O-DU uses these parameters for precoding. • The user data rates depend on both the user priority weights and the set of active O-RUs. Inter-agent collaboration is required to guarantee the minimum data rate requirements. To this end, a monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates, coordinates the user weighting and O-RU management agents, and provides feedback to them until the minimum data rate constraints are satisfied. • Due to the substantial size of LLMs, deploying separate LLM agents in the near-RT RIC limits scalability. To address this issue, we deploy a shared LLM in the near-RT RIC and train a quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) adapter for each agent. This approach preserves agent specialization while greatly reducing memory usage. • Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework in energy-saving mode reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93 % 41.93\% when compared with three baseline schemes. Furthermore, using QLoRA, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92 % 92\% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents. Figure 1: The considered system model. The operator intents are translated into objectives by the supervisor agent in the non-RT RIC. Near-RT agents determine the user priority weights and the set of active O-RUs. Agents in the near-RT RIC share an LLM with different QLoRA adapters. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II , we introduce the system model and formulate the optimization problem. In Section III , we present the proposed framework and describe the role of each agent and the workflow from intent translation to optimization. Performance evaluation is presented in Section IV . Conclusion is given in Section V . Notations : In this paper, ℂ \mathbb{C} and ℝ \mathbb{R} denote the set of complex and real numbers, respectively. Boldface uppercase letters (e.g., 𝐗 \mathbf{X} ) represent matrices, while boldface lowercase letters (e.g., 𝐱 \mathbf{x} ) represent vectors. The N × N N\times N identity matrix is denoted by 𝐈 N \mathbf{I}_{N} . ( ⋅ ) H (\cdot)^{\mathrm{H}} denotes the conjugate transpose of a vector or matrix. For a matrix, tr ⁡ ( ⋅ ) \operatorname{tr}(\cdot) and det ( ⋅ ) \det(\cdot) denote the trace and determinant, respectively. ⟨ 𝐱 , 𝐲 ⟩ \langle\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle denotes the inner product of vectors 𝐱 \mathbf{x} and 𝐲 \mathbf{y} . II System Model and Problem Formulation We consider downlink transmission in a cell-free O-RAN as shown in Fig. 1 . The set of users is denoted by 𝒦 = { 1 , 2 , … , K } \mathcal{K}=\{1,2,\ldots,K\} . The set of O-RUs is denoted by ℒ = { 1 , 2 , … , L } \mathcal{L}=\{1,2,\ldots,L\} . Each O-RU has N t N_{\textrm{t}} transmit antennas. Each user equipment has N r N_{\textrm{r}} receive antennas. The O-DU is connected to O-RUs via open fronthaul (O-FH) links. In cell-free O-RAN, each user k ∈ 𝒦 k\in\mathcal{K} is coherently served by a subset of O-RUs, denoted by ℒ k ⊂ ℒ \mathcal{L}_{k}\subset\mathcal{L} . This results in a more uniform throughput across the coverage area compared to the cellular architecture. The subset of users served by O-RU l ∈ ℒ l\in\mathcal{L} is denoted by 𝒦 l ⊂ 𝒦 \mathcal{K}_{l}\subset\mathcal{K} . The operator may deactivate certain O-RUs during low-traffic periods for energy saving. Let z l ∈ { 0 , 1 } z_{l}\in\{0,1\} denote the O-RU activation variable, where z l = 1 z_{l}=1 if O-RU l l is active and z l = 0 z_{l}=0 otherwise. Let β k , l \beta_{k,l} be the large-scale fading coefficient between user k k and O-RU l l . We use a heuristic [ 10 ] where each user k k can be served by at most L max L^{\textrm{max}} active O-RUs which have the largest β k , l \beta_{k,l} . Let 𝐇 k , l ∈ ℂ N r × N t \mathbf{H}_{k,l}\in\mathbb{C}^{N_{\textrm{r}}\times N_{\textrm{t}}} denote the downlink channel matrix between user k ∈ 𝒦 k\in\mathcal{K} and O-RU l ∈ ℒ l\in\mathcal{L} . Let 𝐕 k , l ∈ ℂ N t × N s \mathbf{V}_{k,l}\in\mathbb{C}^{N_{\textrm{t}}\times N_{\textrm{s}}} denote the precoding matrix at O-RU l l for user k ∈ 𝒦 l k\in\mathcal{K}_{l} , where N s N_{\textrm{s}} is the number of data streams. Let 𝚪 k ∈ ℂ N r × N r \mathbf{\Gamma}_{k}\in\mathbb{C}^{N_{\textrm{r}}\times N_{\textrm{r}}} denote the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) matrix of user k k . It can be expressed as [ 11 ] 𝚪 k = 𝚿 k , k ​ 𝚿 k , k H ​ ( ∑ i ∈ 𝒦 ∖ { k } 𝚿 k , i ​ 𝚿 k , i H + σ 2 ​ 𝐈 N r ) − 1 , \mathbf{\Gamma}_{k}=\mathbf{\Psi}_{k,k}\mathbf{\Psi}_{k,k}^{\textrm{H}}\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{K}\setminus\{k\}}\mathbf{\Psi}_{k,i}\mathbf{\Psi}_{k,i}^{\textrm{H}}+\sigma^{2}\mathbf{I}_{N_{\textrm{r}}}\right)^{-1}, (1) where σ 2 \sigma^{2} is the variance of the additive white Gaussian noise, and 𝚿 k , i = ∑ l ∈ ℒ i 𝐇 k , l ​ 𝐕 i , l ∈ ℂ N r × N s \mathbf{\Psi}_{k,i}=\sum_{l\in\mathcal{L}_{i}}\mathbf{H}_{k,l}\mathbf{V}_{i,l}\in\mathbb{C}^{N_{\textrm{r}}\times N_{\textrm{s}}} denotes the effective channel matrix for user k k if i = k i=k , and the effective interference matrix from user i i to user k k otherwise. The achievable data rate of user k ∈ 𝒦 k\in\mathcal{K} is given by r k = log 2 ​ det ( 𝐈 N r + 𝚪 k ) r_{k}=\log_{2}\det\left(\mathbf{I}_{N_{\textrm{r}}}+\mathbf{\Gamma}_{k}\right) . The optimization problem aims to maximize a utility function while satisfying the minimum rate requirements of users and the maximum transmit power at each O-RU. We have maximize 𝐕 k , l , z l k ∈ 𝒦 , l ∈ ℒ \displaystyle\operatorname*{maximize}\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}\mathbf{V}_{k,l},z_{l}\\ k\in\mathcal{K},l\in\mathcal{L}\end{subarray}} U ​ ( 𝐕 , 𝐳 ) \displaystyle\quad U(\mathbf{V},\mathbf{z}) (2a) subject to r k ≥ R k min , k ∈ 𝒦 \displaystyle\quad r_{k}\geq R_{k}^{\textrm{min}},\;k\in\mathcal{K} (2b) ∑ k ∈ 𝒦 l tr ⁡ ( 𝐕 k , l ​ 𝐕 k , l H ) ≤ z l ​ P max , l ∈ ℒ \displaystyle\quad\sum_{k\in\mathcal{K}_{l}}\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{V}_{k,l}\mathbf{V}_{k,l}^{\textrm{H}}\right)\leq z_{l}P^{\textrm{max}},\;l\in\mathcal{L} (2c) z l ∈ { 0 , 1 } , l ∈ ℒ , \displaystyle\quad z_{l}\in\{0,1\},\;l\in\mathcal{L}, (2d) where U ​ ( ⋅ ) U(\cdot) is the utility function. 𝐕 = [ 𝐕 k , l , ∀ k ∈ 𝒦 , l ∈ ℒ ] \mathbf{V}=\left[\mathbf{V}_{k,l},\;\forall k\in\mathcal{K},l\in\mathcal{L}\right] is the stacked precoding matrix. 𝐳 = [ z l , ∀ l ∈ ℒ ] \mathbf{z}=\left[z_{l},\;\forall l\in\mathcal{L}\right] is the stacked O-RU activation vector. Constraint ( 2b ) guarantees the minimum data rate requirement R k min R_{k}^{\textrm{min}} of each user k k . Constraint ( 2c ) enforces the transmit power limit at each O-RU. If O-RU l l is active, i.e., z l = 1 z_{l}=1 , then its total transmit power must not exceed P max P^{\textrm{max}} . If O-RU l l is inactive, i.e., z l = 0 z_{l}=0 , then its transmit power is set to zero. We consider two types of objective functions. The first type corresponds to the aggregate utility, defined as U = ∑ k ∈ 𝒦 U k ​ ( r k ) U=\sum_{k\in\mathcal{K}}U_{k}(r_{k}) , where U k ​ ( r k ) U_{k}(r_{k}) is a concave utility function. The second type targets energy savings, defined as U = − ∑ l ∈ ℒ z l U=-\sum_{l\in\mathcal{L}}z_{l} , which aims to minimize the number of active O-RUs. In both cases, problem ( 2 ) is nonconvex due to the nonconvexity of the objective function ( 2a ) and constraint ( 2b ). III Agentic AI Framework for Cell-free O-RAN In this section, we first propose algorithms to solve problem ( 2 ) for both types of objective functions. In the case of aggregate-utility maximization, the number of active O-RUs does not appear in the objective function. Therefore, we keep all the O-RUs active, i.e., z l = 1 , l ∈ ℒ z_{l}=1,\;l\in\mathcal{L} , and let the precoding algorithm determine the power allocation across O-RUs to maximize the aggregate utility. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, constraint ( 2b ) can be incorporated into the objective function ( 2a ). Constraint ( 2c ) remains as an explicit constraint in the dual problem. The partial Lagrange dual function is g ​ ( 𝝁 ) = sup 𝐕 ∈ 𝒟 ∑ k ∈ 𝒦 ( U k ​ ( r k ) + μ k ​ ( r k − R k min ) ) g(\boldsymbol{\mu})=\sup_{\mathbf{V}\in\mathcal{D}}\sum_{k\in\mathcal{K}}\left(U_{k}(r_{k})+\mu_{k}\left(r_{k}-R_{k}^{\textrm{min}}\right)\right) , where 𝝁 = [ μ k , ∀ k ∈ 𝒦 ] ⊤ \boldsymbol{\mu}=\left[\mu_{k},\;\forall k\in\mathcal{K}\right]^{\top} is the vector of Lagrange multipliers, and 𝒟 = { 𝐕 : ∑ k ∈ 𝒦 l tr ⁡ ( 𝐕 k , l ​ 𝐕 k , l H ) ≤ P max , l ∈ ℒ } \mathcal{D}=\left\{\mathbf{V}:\sum_{k\in\mathcal{K}_{l}}\operatorname{tr}\left(\mathbf{V}_{k,l}\mathbf{V}_{k,l}^{\textrm{H}}\right)\leq P^{\textrm{max}},l\in\mathcal{L}\right\} . To obtain the dual function, we need to solve the inner supremum over 𝐕 \mathbf{V} . Let U ~ k ​ ( r k ) = U k ​ ( r k ) + μ k ​ ( r k − R k min ) \tilde{U}_{k}(r_{k})=U_{k}(r_{k})+\mu_{k}\left(r_{k}-R_{k}^{\textrm{min}}\right) . Thus, we have maximize 𝐕 k , l , k ∈ 𝒦 l , l ∈ ℒ ∑ k ∈ 𝒦 U ~ k \displaystyle\operatorname*{maximize}\limits_{\begin{subarray}{c}\mathbf{V}_{k,l},\\ k\in\mathcal{K}_{l},l\in\mathcal{L}\end{subarray}}\quad\sum_{k\in\mathcal{K}}\tilde{U}_{
