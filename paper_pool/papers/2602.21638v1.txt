Title: Multi-dimensional Assessment and Explainable Feedback for Counselor Responses to Client Resistance in Text-based Counseling with LLMs

Abstract: Effectively addressing client resistance is a sophisticated clinical skill in psychological counseling, yet practitioners often lack timely and scalable supervisory feedback to refine their approaches. Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance.

I Introduction Figure 1: Overview of our framework for evaluating counselor responses to client resistance. The framework comprises four core communication mechanisms: Respect for Autonomy , Stance Alignment , Emotional Resonance , and Conversational Orientation . For each mechanism, responses are further categorized into three levels of expression: no expression, weak expression, and strong expression. Our computational approach simultaneously identifies the strength of these dimensions along with their underlying explanations. Psychological counseling is a profoundly interactive and dialogue-driven process, the efficacy of which depends largely on the counselor’s capacity to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics. Central to these challenges is the phenomenon of client resistance, where clients oppose or diverge from the established therapeutic trajectory [ 4 , 21 ] . Counselors’ responses to such resistance are therefore crucial: when addressed skillfully, it can open a pathway to uncovering clients’ underlying conflicts; when mishandled, it may erode the therapeutic alliance or result in premature termination. Skillfully responding to client resistance remains a challenge, largely due to the fact that counselors often receive limited and delayed feedback regarding the quality of their interventions. In traditional training and supervision, feedback is typically sparse, retrospective, and dependent on expert availability, making it difficult for counselors, especially novices, to recognize suboptimal responses or explore alternative strategies in a timely manner [ 13 , 3 ] . As a result, counselors may repeatedly rely on habitual response patterns, even when these patterns inadvertently reinforce resistance. This issue is further exacerbated in text-based counseling settings, where supervision is less structured and many non-verbal interactional cues are absent. Although experienced supervisors can evaluate counselor responses along multiple dimensions, such assessments are neither scalable nor consistently accessible to the broader workforce. Existing research has explored the feasibility of applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide counselors with feedback [ 15 ] . Some studies focus on macro-level analysis, such as classifying overall dialogue quality or understanding global constructs like the therapeutic alliance using LLMs [ 19 ] . Others concentrate on assessing competencies in specific counseling skills, such as empathy [ 26 ] and reflective listening [ 23 ] , by differentiating between high and low quality or providing numeric scores. However, these approaches are generally designed for broad counseling contexts and evaluate discrete, isolated skills. They lack a dedicated framework to evaluate how counselors navigate specific, high-stakes clinical moments, particularly in responding to client resistance. To address this gap, this study establishes an integrated pipeline spanning theoretical framework, annotated data construction, model development, and empirical validation. In collaboration with psychological experts, and by adapting and synthesizing established theories [ 24 , 25 , 11 ] , we propose a four-dimensional framework for evaluating counselor responses to client resistance in text-based counseling. Moving beyond holistic judgments, this framework decomposes counselor replies along four interrelated yet distinct communication mechanisms: respect for autonomy, stance alignment, emotional resonance, and conversational orientation, thereby providing clear and operational criteria for assessment. Guided by this framework, we curate a high-quality annotated dataset of resistance-response excerpts drawn from real-world counseling scenarios. Trained psychology students assign multi-dimensional ratings and craft explanatory rationales with high reliability. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone. Experimental results demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms the zero-shot performance of advanced general-purpose LLMs, including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, across all four communication mechanisms. Specifically, our model achieves macro-F1 scores of up to 81%, compared to approximately 45% for the strongest baseline. Further ablation studies show that incorporating explicit textual explanations during training yields an additional improvement of around 4 F1 points over models trained solely with labels, highlighting the critical role of explanation-based supervision. Beyond classification, our model is also capable of generating high-quality explanatory feedback. Both automated and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the generated explanations: our model nearly doubles the BLEU-1 score of top-tier baselines (0.60 vs. 0.32) and receives near-ceiling human ratings (2.8-2.9 out of 3.0) in terms of framework consistency, evidence anchoring, and clarity and specificity. These results indicate that the model not only identifies suboptimal counselor responses but also provides theoretically grounded and actionable guidance. Finally, we examine the practical utility of AI-generated feedback for assisting counselor to address client resistance. In a controlled between–within experiment with 43 counselors, those receiving model-generated feedback show significantly greater improvements in response quality than a control group without LLM-based feedback. These results highlight the potential of our approach as a scalable, theory-informed tool for supporting counselor skill development.

Recent studies have increasingly applied NLP techniques to the automated analysis and understanding of large-scale mental health-related conversations [ 27 ] . Some studies adopt a dialogue-level perspective, assessing global constructs such as treatment fidelity [ 3 ] , the counselor–client therapeutic alliance [ 12 ] , clients’ personality traits [ 16 , 29 ] , and mental health states including anxiety and depression symptoms [ 15 ] . In parallel, other work conducts fine-grained, process-level analyses to identify counselors’ intervention intents and strategies [ 5 ] , as well as clients’ suicide intent [ 8 ] , behaviors [ 20 ] , and emotional states [ 28 , 17 ] . In addition, research on evaluating counselor performance has largely focused on the quality of specific counseling skills, most notably empathy [ 26 ] and reflective listening [ 23 ] . LLM for Providing Feedback to Counselors. With the emergence of large language models, a growing body of work has begun to leverage LLMs to provide structured feedback and evaluation to support counselors [ 9 ] . Some studies incorporate expert knowledge into LLMs through carefully designed prompts, enabling models to analyze counselor–client dialogues and assess the therapeutic alliance across dimensions. These approaches further identify systematic weaknesses in counselors’ relationship-building abilities and offer targeted guidance for improvement [ 19 ] . Beyond alliance-focused analysis, [ 6 ] introduced a multi-level feedback framework for peer counseling, training a small-scale LLM to infer the counseling goal, identify specific areas for improvement, and propose an alternative response given a specific situation. Similarly, [ 14 ] proposed the CARE system, which diagnoses the counseling strategies required in a given situation and suggests example responses during practice sessions. Through user studies, they demonstrated that CARE effectively supports skill development among novice counselors. Despite this progress, relatively little work has explicitly addressed client resistance, a critical yet challenging phenomenon in psychological counseling. Recently, [ 18 ] developed an automatic model to detect and classify client fine-grained resistance behaviors. In contrast, our work takes a further step by focusing on the quality of counselors’ responses to client resistance , aiming to provide more direct and actionable guidance for counselors to adapt and refine their intervention strategies. III Evaluation Framework To identify the core dimensions of therapists’ moment-to-moment responses that effectively address clients’ interpersonal resistance, we propose a novel framework for multidimensional analysis of counselor responses. The framework was developed through close collaboration with professional clinical supervisors who possess extensive experience in both psychotherapy practice and therapist supervision. Drawing on established psychological theories [ 10 , 24 ] , we synthesize key dimensions that are central to addressing client resistance in practice and systematically adapt them to the context of text-based counseling. The proposed framework comprises four core communication mechanisms that collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on how counselors respond to client resistance: Respect for Autonomy , Stance Alignment , Emotional Resonance , and Conversational Direction . For each mechanism, counselor responses are evaluated across three levels of expression: (0) No Expression , where the mechanism is entirely absent; (1) Weak Expression , where it is present but only minimally articulated; and (2) Strong Expression , where it is clearly and substantively demonstrated. We illustrate this framework using the following client resistance scenario: the counselor invites the client to consider self-care, while the client resists the suggestion by framing rest as incompatible with their perceived family responsibility . (1) Respect for Autonomy. Respect for Autonomy refers to the counselor’s recognition and support of the client’s self-determination, a foundational principle underlying the entire therapeutic process. A no expression of autonomy respect is marked by didactic responses that pressure the client toward compliance (e.g., If you burn out, that will hurt your family more—that’s truly irresponsibility ). In contrast, a strong expression affirms the client’s values and encourages exploration of their own thoughts without imposing outcomes (e.g., Exactly, being the backbone of your family carries a great deal of responsibility ). (2) Emotional Resonance. Emotional resonance indicates the counselor’s ability to accurately perceive, understand, and reflect the client’s deep emotional experiences, fostering a sense of containment and psychological safety that is beneficial for the decrease of the resistance behaviors and advancement of therapeutic processes. A no expression neglects or distorts the client’s emotions (e.g, From a family systems perspective, an overfunctioning backbone can foster dependency in others. ). A weak expression reflects superficial empathy, focusing only on external events or rational analysis (e.g., Yes, having family responsibilities is not easy. ). A strong expression articulates the client’s underlying emotions and intentions (e.g, Carrying that weight alone must be exhausting and lonely at times. ). (3) Stance Alignment. Stance alignment refers to the counselor’s adjustment of their communication to align with with client’s position or perspective. A no expression indicates an oppositional or challenging stance (e.g, But have you considered that believing you’re indispensable may reflect an unbalanced family pattern? ). A weak expression positions the counselor as a detached, third-party observer, acknowledging the situation without fully engaging with the client’s perspective (e.g., This is a real dilemma. ). A strong expression demonstrates cognitive alignment with the client, supporting their values while collaboratively exploring constructive approaches (e.g, Your family comes first—that’s clear and admirable. Let’s figure out how you can keep being their strong support, but in a way that doesn’t wear you down over time. ) (4) Conversational Orientation. Conversational direction describes how the therapist’s response can guide the conversation toward a deeper and a more meaningful exploration of the client’s psychological status, alleviating client resistance by fostering a sense of direction within the session. A no expression persuade or debate with the client that lead the counseling process toward a negative trajectory (e.g., Now we should finish today’s stre
