## Introduction

This paper investigates the hypothesis: *{{ hypothesis }}*.

We apply the following modifications to the baseline: {{ actions }}.

## Method

We run a controlled experiment comparing baseline and treatment configurations
across {{ n_seeds }} random seeds. The primary metric is **{{ metric }}**.

**Control:** {{ control }}

**Treatment:** {{ treatment }}

## Results

{{ analysis_summary }}

The following figure summarizes the results:

![Baseline vs Treatment](../03_results/fig1.png)

| Group | Mean | Std | N |
|-------|------|-----|---|
{% for row in summary_rows %}| {{ row.group }} | {{ row.mean }} | {{ row.std }} | {{ row.n }} |
{% endfor %}

## Limitations

- This is a toy experiment with a simplified scoring function.
- Only {{ n_seeds }} seeds were used; more trials would increase confidence.
- The action space is restricted to predefined parameter changes.
- No statistical significance test was performed.

## Conclusion

{{ conclusion }}
