  "rationale": "Pattern pat_32f9328cb109 highlights that differential learning rates for low-rank matrices improve optimization stability and lead to faster convergence. By lowering both the learning rate and LoRA rank, we expect to enhance stability and achieve better task-specific adaptation.",
  "novelty_note": "This combination has not been tried before. Previous experiments have only explored increasing learning rates and LoRA rank together."
