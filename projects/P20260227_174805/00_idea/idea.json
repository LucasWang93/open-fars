  "rationale": "The pattern indicates that combining differential learning rates with modifications to low-rank matrices, such as increasing LoRA rank, improves task-specific adaptation and representational capacity. A higher learning rate complements this by enabling faster updates, potentially enhancing adaptation further.",
  "novelty_note": "This combination (lr_up, lora_rank_up) has not been tried before in this task space."
