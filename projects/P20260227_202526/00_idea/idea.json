  "rationale": "The pattern highlights the importance of learning rate schedules, which are closely tied to warmup strategies, in achieving balanced exploration and convergence. Extending warmup can stabilize early optimization dynamics, while increasing epochs allows the model to utilize this stability for more robust convergence.",
  "novelty_note": "This combination has not been tested before, as prior experiments focused on learning rate and low-rank adjustments rather than warmup and epoch tuning."
